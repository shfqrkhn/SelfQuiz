If the team is not conducting the Daily Standup, problems can remain unidentified, negatively impacting project delivery. The Daily Standup is a 15-minute time-boxed event where team members discuss what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and anything blocking their progress. Discussing technical solutions should happen outside the standup.",
